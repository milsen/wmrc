wmrc
====

A simple WM powered by wmutils, comprised of pure POSIX-compliant shell scripts.

Installation
------------

Note that this expects that you run startx/xinit from a tty, not use a login manager (e.g. gdm, sddm, etc).

First off,  you need to compile/install the following:

* wmutils/libwm
* wmutils/core
* My fork of wmutils/opt
* https://github.com/ix/disputils
* killwa
* sxhkd
* dmenu
* Any virtual terminal

Highly recommended:

* lemonbar
* dash - insanely fast posix-compliant shell. symlink to /bin/sh for best performance in most scripts
* hsetroot - wallpaper
* compton - tearing protection and shadows and such

If you don't already have them, copy sxhkdrc.default to ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc, and copy xinitrc.default to ~/.xinitrc.

Uncomment the features you would like in .xinitrc.

Copy config.default to ~/.config/wmrc/config.

globals and disp go in ~/.config/wmrc/. These are global variables which
you absolutely need, or there will be quite bad damage to ~.

If you wish to use pulsew, then copy colors.default to
~/.config/wmrc/colors.

Navigate to opt/ and run make. This is required for use of the mouse when focusing windows. If you do not want this, change 4 to 7 in evhandle.

Throw all the scripts somewhere in your PATH. Enjoy.
